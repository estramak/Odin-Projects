    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Definitely for a comfort meal night</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>6 skin on, bone in chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 pint grape tomatoes or cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>5 ounces baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 (5.3 ounce) package garlic and herb spreadable cheese, such as Boursin®</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and place skin side down in the hot skillet. Cook undisturbed until well browned, crisp, and releases easily from the skillet, 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip chicken and cook an additional 1 to 2 minutes.  Remove chicken from the pan and set aside (chicken will not be cooked through at this point).  </li>
        <li>Add onion to the drippings in the pan, and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add tomatoes, and cook until tomatoes soften and begin to burst, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in beans and remaining salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Return chicken to the pan, skin side up, along with any juices that have accumulated. Return to a simmer; cover, reduce heat slightly, and cook until chicken is tender and cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a serving platter. Stir in spinach until wilted and then add in Boursin. Stir until melted and heated through. Season to taste with more salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken over bean stew.</li>
    </ol>
