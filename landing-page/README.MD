# Landing Page - The Odin Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a simple, visually appealing landing page created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The project demonstrates a foundational understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling, with a particular focus on using Flexbox for layout.

## Features

The landing page is a single-page static site divided into several distinct sections:

*   **Header:** Features a logo on the left and navigation links on the right.
*   **Hero Section:** Contains a bold title, descriptive subtext, a "Sign Up" button, and a placeholder image.
*   **Information Gallery:** A section displaying four images, each with a corresponding caption.
*   **Quote Section:** An inspiring quote or testimonial, styled distinctly from the rest of the page.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** A final prompt for user engagement, with a headline, supporting text, and another "Sign Up" button.
*   **Footer:** A simple footer with copyright information.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling, including colors, fonts, and layout.
    *   **Flexbox:** Used extensively to create responsive and aligned layouts for the navigation bar, hero content, gallery, and CTA section.
*   **Google Fonts:** The "Roboto" font family is imported and used throughout the page.
